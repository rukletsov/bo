LIBRARY
================================================================================
* CMake msvc compiler options.
* CMake different options for debug/release configuration.
* Supress msvc unsafe CRT warnings.
* Put windows-dependent code under #ifdef.


Mesh class
================================================================================
* Check algorithms and investigate speed-up possibilites (pointers, inline, etc).
* Add logging levels in operator <<().
* Make Mesh thread-safe.
* Do not add duplicated faces, edges, points.
? Do not add "close" points, e.g. which are in radius of two-three floats; 
  use existed point instead.
* Make well-designed accessor functions (see standard graph representations).
* Implement "primitive-object" for Mesh class in order to visualize a Mesh.
? Merge current Mesh implementation with Pasha's one.
* Create vertex moving function.


Vector<> class
================================================================================
* Make an n-dimensional vector based on boost::array.
* Inherit Vector2<>, Vector3<>, Vector4<> from new n-Vector<> class.
* Add useful mathematical methods.
* Speed-up.
